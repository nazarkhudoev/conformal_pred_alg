# Conformal Predictors in Identifying Protein Sequences

Project Overview

This project explores the application of conformal predictors, a machine learning framework, to enhance the identification of protein sequences in bioinformatics. Conformal predictors provide statistically valid prediction intervals with user-specified confidence levels, making them ideal for reliable protein sequence analysis.
